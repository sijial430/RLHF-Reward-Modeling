# RLHF-Reward-Modeling

## Structure 

The initial release of tis project focus on the Bradley-Terry reward modeling and pairwise preference model. Since then, we have included more advanced techniques to construct preference model. The structure of this project is 

- [`bradley-terry-rm`](./bradley-terry-rm/) to train the classic Bradley-Terry reward model;
- [`pair-pm`](./pair-pm/) to train the pairwise preference model, which takes a prompt and **two responses** as the input and directly predicts the probability of the first response is being preferred. We formulate the problem as a chat between the user and the model to leverage the next-token prediction ability of the model, which is referred to as generative RM in the subsequent literature.
	- [`SSRM`](./pair-pm/SRRM/): the code of the paper [Semi-Supervised Reward Modeling via Iterative Self-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06903)
 	- [`RRM`](./pair-pm/RRM/): to leverage casual inference to augment the preference dataset and mitigate the reward hacking. See https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13156v1 	
- [`armo-rm`](./armo-rm/) to train the ArmoRM, which starts with a multi-objective reward model and the reward vector is aggregated by a mixture-of-expert approach in a context-dependent way. See our technical report [[ArmoRM] Interpretable Preferences via Multi-Objective Reward Modeling and Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12845) for details.
- [`odin-rm`](./odin/) to disentangle the reward modeling from length bias. See https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07319
- [`math-rm`](./math-rm/): the code to train process-supervised reward (PRM) and outcome-supervised reward (ORM) using the next-token prediction. We open-source the data, code, hyper-parameter, and model for a robust recipe that is easy to reproduce.

## Installation instructions

It is recommeded to create separate environmnets for the Bradley-Terry reward model and pair wise preference model. The installation instructions are provided in the corresponding folders.


## Dataset Preparation
The dataset should be preprocessed as the standard format, where each of the sample consists of two conversations 'chosen' and 'rejected' and they share the same prompt. Here is an example of the rejected sample in the comparison pair. 

```python
[
{ "content": "Please identify the top 5 rarest animals in the world.", "role": "user" },
{ "content": "Do you mean animals that are really rare, or rare relative to the size of the human population?", "role": "assistant" },
{ "content": "The ones that are really rare.", "role": "user" },
{ "content": "Alright, hereâ€™s what I found:", "role": "assistant" }, 
]
```

We preprocess many open-source preference datasets into the standard format and upload them to the hugginface hub. You can find them [HERE](https://huggingface.co/collections/RLHFlow/standard-format-preference-dataset-662eec0252e194d5d40c252a). We have also searched and found that some of the following mixture of preference dataset useful.

- [hendrydong/preference_700K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hendrydong/preference_700K)
- [RLHFlow/UltraFeedback-preference-standard](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RLHFlow/UltraFeedback-preference-standard) 
where the details can be found in the dataset card. 

## Evaluation Results

You can evaluate the resulting reward model with the dataset provided by [benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/reward-bench) by the following command.

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python ./useful_code/eval_reward_bench_bt.py --reward_name_or_path ./models/gemma_2b_mixture2_last_checkpoint --record_dir ./bench_mark_eval.txt
```
